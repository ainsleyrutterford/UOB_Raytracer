## [Computer Graphics Raytracer](https://github.com/ainsleyrutterford/UOB_Raytracer)
### Overview
This project involved building a Real-Time Raytracer from scratch using OpenCL, GLM and SDL. As can be seen in this [video](https://streamable.com/rn875), the raytracer was used to render the [Cornell Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box) where phenomena such as reflection and refraction have been showcased. The realism of the rendered image was improved further using anti-aliasing and soft shadows. Other Cornell Box scenes are shown in the images below:
