## Compile and Run

## Requirementss
Raytracer:
50% completed. Extensions:
- Ported the code to OpenCL. Achieves 30-40 FPS on a GTX 1070, as seen in attached video
- Soft shadows via multiple light sources.
- Anti-aliasing.
- Spheres.
- Mirrors (works correctly with the sphere too).
- Glass (works correctly with the sphere too).
- Cramers rule for the intersections.

There is an attached video, 21.mp4 along with 3 showcase images.


We have attached a GPU version of the raytracer, this will need a GPU and openCL in order to run.
We will bring a laptop so that we can ssh a server with a GPU, however,
this does suffer from some latency.
